# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Octovel maintains multiple open source projects, each with its own versioning and support policy. Please refer to the individual project's documentation for specific version support information.

### General Support Policy

- We provide security updates for the latest major version of each project
- Critical security fixes may be backported to previous major versions on a case-by-case basis
- Projects in version 0.x are considered experimental and may not receive security updates

### Finding Version Information

1. Check the project's `README.md` or `SECURITY.md` file
2. Look for the "Releases" section in the project's GitHub repository
3. Visit our [documentation](https://docs.octovel.com) for detailed version support

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Private Disclosure Process

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email your findings to [security@octovel.com](mailto:security@octovel.com)
3. Include the following information:
   - Project name and version
   - Vulnerability description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Any proof-of-concept code
   - Your contact information

### Our Commitment

- We will respond to your report within 3 business days
- We will keep you informed about the progress of the vulnerability resolution
- We will credit you in our security acknowledgments (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Updates and Alerts

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) for the latest minor version. We recommend always using the latest version of our software.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Always keep your dependencies up to date
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where available
- Review and understand the permissions you grant to applications

### For Contributors

- Follow secure coding practices
- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) to version control
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Keep dependencies updated and remove unused ones
- Write and maintain tests for security-critical code

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- We follow best practices for data protection and privacy
- Sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Regular security audits are performed on our infrastructure

### Third-party Dependencies

- We regularly update our dependencies to include security patches
- All third-party code is reviewed before integration
- We monitor for known vulnerabilities in our dependencies

## Contact

For security-related inquiries, please contact [security@octovel.com](mailto:security@octovel.com).

## Legal

By submitting a vulnerability report, you agree to our [responsible disclosure policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure). We will not take legal action against security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
- Only interact with accounts they own or have explicit permission to test
- Provide us with reasonable time to address the issue before any public disclosure
