# Octovel Open Source Licensing Policy

Octovel uses permissive open-source licenses, primarily MIT and Apache 2.0, to promote transparency, reuse, and collaboration while maintaining legal protection.

* **MIT** is preferred for lightweight tools and SDKs.
* **Apache 2.0** is used for larger frameworks requiring patent and contribution clarity.

### License Compatibility

All dependencies must be **license-compatible** with MIT/Apache.
Use of **GPL, AGPL, or non-commercial licenses** is strictly prohibited. Developers must verify third-party licenses before inclusion.

### Attribution

Each repository must include:

* A `LICENSE` file for the main license
* A `NOTICE` or `ATTRIBUTIONS.md` file listing third-party credits
* Original license headers retained in modified files
