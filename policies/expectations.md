# Project Completion Expectations

Octovel encourages developers to finish what they start. Projects should be completed, maintained, or clearly marked as inactive, we avoid leaving unfinished or abandoned work whenever possible.

If a maintainer can no longer continue development, they are expected to communicate the project’s status and coordinate with the team to determine the next steps. Depending on the situation, the project may be:

* **Transferred** to another maintainer,
* **Paused** until resources become available, or
* **Archived** to preserve history and prevent confusion.

Clear handoff notes and documentation are strongly recommended before stepping away. This ensures continuity, transparency, and respect for contributors’ time and the community’s trust.
