# Octovel Intellectual Property & Confidentiality Policy

Octovel operates as an open-source organization, but not all information is public.
While our codebases are transparent and community-driven, any non-public data, credentials, or internal resources remain strictly confidential.

All infrastructure details, environment files, tokens, unreleased projects, and business operations are protected assets. Sharing or exposing such data outside authorized channels is prohibited, even unintentionally.

Private repositories, deployment tools, and backend configurations require **explicit access approval**. Public repos must never contain sensitive data (e.g., API keys, secrets, or internal endpoints). Contributors must report any accidental leaks immediately.

Security standards apply to everyone:

* MFA, encrypted connections, and secure devices are mandatory.
* No use of personal storage, chats, or cloud apps for internal data.
* Confidentiality obligations continue after collaboration ends.

Octovelâ€™s principle: open code, closed secrets.
Transparency drives our development, but privacy and security protect our infrastructure, people, and partners.
