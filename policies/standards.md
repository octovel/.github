## 1. Engineering Philosophy & Core Principles

Defines Octovel’s engineering mindset — **clarity, simplicity, and shared ownership**. All code must be maintainable, predictable, and scalable. Follow proven principles like DRY, SOLID, and KISS. Prioritize readability and long-term maintainability over clever solutions.

---

## 2. Technology Stack & Language Guidelines

Outlines approved languages and frameworks (TypeScript, Rust, Python, C#, Go, etc.). Teams have flexibility but must justify new adoptions through short design proposals. Prefer minimal dependencies and sustainable tech choices with active ecosystems.

---

## 3. Project & Repository Standards

Every repository follows a clean, predictable structure (`source`, `tests`, `infrastructure`, `.github`, `docs`). Repositories are documented, version-controlled, and include setup instructions. Configuration must be environment-based and validated on startup.

---

## 4. Code Quality & Style Guidelines

Applies automated formatting and linting across all languages. Standardize naming conventions and documentation style. Code must be modular, low in complexity, and self-explanatory. Include meaningful comments that clarify **intent**, not syntax.

---

## 5. Version Control & Collaboration Workflow

Defines how developers collaborate via Git. All changes go through branches and pull requests. Use **Conventional Commits** and follow semantic versioning. Reviews ensure code correctness, clarity, and adherence to shared principles.

---

## 6. Testing, Validation & CI/CD

Every repository must include tests at multiple levels (unit, integration, e2e). Testing frameworks depend on the language (Jest, Pytest, etc.). CI pipelines enforce testing, linting, and type checks before merging.

---

## 7. Documentation & Knowledge Maintenance

Documentation lives alongside code and evolves with it. Each repo must have a `README`, contributing guide, and `/docs`. Knowledge should flow freely across teams — ADRs, internal wikis, and changelogs keep everyone informed.

---

## 8. Security, Privacy & Compliance

All code must be secure by default. Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, and use environment variables for secrets. Use OAuth2 or JWT for authentication. Follow least-privilege principles. Logs must exclude sensitive data.

---

## 9. APIs, Data & Integration

Defines best practices for REST/GraphQL APIs, database schemas, and service interactions. Enforce versioning (`/v1/`), validation, and error consistency. Database schemas must be version-controlled, with migrations and indexes documented.

---

## 10. Performance, Reliability & Monitoring

Code must perform predictably under load. Measure, benchmark, and profile critical paths. Services must expose metrics and health endpoints. Use Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK for observability.

---

## 11. DevOps, Deployment & Environments

Covers automation and deployment standards. CI/CD pipelines handle testing, builds, and rollouts. Deployments are containerized (Docker) and orchestrated (Kubernetes). Infrastructure is declarative (Terraform).

---

## 12. Dependencies, Packages & Tooling

Keep dependencies minimal and updated. Use lockfiles and automated dependency scanning. Prefer internal libraries for shared utilities. Standardize build tools (pnpm, Cargo, Pipenv) per language ecosystem.

---

## 13. Accessibility, UX & Internationalization

All frontends must meet **WCAG 2.1 AA**. Applications supporting multiple languages use standardized i18n frameworks. Accessibility and usability reviews are integrated into QA.

---

## 14. Open Source, Contribution & Ethics

Encourages community involvement under a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**. Contributions must meet Octovel’s quality and security standards. Respect, transparency, and inclusion are mandatory in all interactions.

---

## 15. Team Culture, Growth & Learning

Fosters a culture of trust, feedback, and growth. Teams are encouraged to share learnings, mentor peers, and hold internal knowledge sessions. Learning is part of the workflow — professional growth is everyone’s responsibility.
