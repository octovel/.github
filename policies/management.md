# Octovel Repository Management Authorization Policy

All repository operations within the Octovel organization are tightly controlled to maintain security, structure, and compliance. Any creation, deletion, renaming, transfer, or visibility change must receive **explicit written authorization** from the **CTO or designated engineering leadership** before execution. Unauthorized actions risk compromising intellectual property, introducing inconsistencies, or exposing internal assets.

Repositories must follow standard naming conventions using clear, descriptive **kebab-case** formats (e.g., `api-gateway-service`, `frontend-dashboard`). Ambiguous or inconsistent names are not permitted, ensuring the organization’s repository ecosystem remains clear and scalable.

To request authorization, contributors must submit a formal justification, detailing purpose, visibility, and ownership, through the official channels (Discord `#resources` or `cto@octovel.com`). Requests are reviewed within two business days, and written approval must be archived for auditing.

This centralized process safeguards Octovel’s security, consistency, and governance, preventing accidental exposure or duplication of repositories.
Violations, including unapproved repository creation or modification, constitute serious breaches and may result in disciplinary or legal action.

In short, **no repository action occurs without CTO approval**, a principle that ensures Octovel’s engineering standards remain cohesive, secure, and professionally managed.
