# Octovel Contributor Agreement

This agreement defines the terms under which individuals contribute to Octovel projects. It applies to voluntary contributors, not employees or contractors.

By submitting code, documentation, or other materials (“Contributions”), the contributor grants Octovel a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense those contributions as part of Octovel projects.
All contributions are considered intentionally submitted under the project’s open-source license, ensuring compatibility and legal clarity.

Contributors retain ownership of their work but agree that Octovel may continue to use, modify, and distribute their contributions even if they later stop participating or leave the community.

Participation is **voluntary**, and contributors may withdraw from active involvement at any time. However, prior contributions remain under Octovel’s license and may be maintained, refactored, or redistributed as part of ongoing development.

By contributing, you acknowledge that your work becomes part of Octovel’s collective open-source ecosystem and that Octovel may use it to advance its projects without additional permission.
