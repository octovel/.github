# Recognition and Credit Policy

At Octovel, every contribution matters, from code commits to documentation updates and design ideas. This policy ensures that all contributors receive **proper credit and recognition** for their work.

### Contributor Recognition

All contributors are listed in the repository’s `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file or within the project’s documentation. This file is regularly maintained by the project’s maintainers to reflect both ongoing and past contributions accurately.

### Contributor Spotlight

Outstanding contributors may be featured in periodic spotlights across Octovel’s communication channels, including GitHub, Discord, and community announcements. Recognition is based on consistency, quality, collaboration, and impact on the project.

### Appreciation & Thanks

Octovel expresses gratitude through public acknowledgments, badges, or mentions in release notes. In some cases, top contributors may be invited to join core teams or receive additional project privileges.

### Policy Summary

Credit is always transparent, fair, and permanent. Once recognized, a contributor’s impact remains part of Octovel’s history, honoring the open-source spirit of shared creation and collaboration.
